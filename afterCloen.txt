1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you have cloned your repository.

2. **Activate Virtual Environment **: If you are using a virtual environment (which is a good practice), activate it. For example, if you're using `venv`:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages using `pip`. Assuming your project has a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies, you can install them like this:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Your Application**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run your application as usual. For example:

   ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
